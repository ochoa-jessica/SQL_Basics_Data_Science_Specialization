Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000 
vi. friend table = 10000 
vii. hours table = 10000 
viii. photo table = 10000 
ix. review table = 10000 
x. tip table = 10000 
xi. user table = 10000 
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562 
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute =  1115 
v. Review = 10000 
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10000 
viii. Tip = 537
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

Answer: no

FROM user
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY total_num_reviews DESC
LIMIT 3

| Yuri   |              1339 |
+--------+-------------------+

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

Based on the SQL query result in the table below, we can see Gerald with a total of 2000 	  reviews has 253 fans, that is an average of 7 fans per review. On the other hand, Sara with a total of 1629 reviews has 50 fans, that us an average of 32 fans per review. Therefore, we can conclude that posing more reviews does not correlate with more fans.	

SELECT 
    name, 
    SUM(review_count) AS total_review, 
    fans, 
    SUM(review_count)/fans AS avg_review_per_fan

    business.name,
    business.city,
    category.category,

+----------------------------------------+-----------------------------+--------------+-------------+---------+----------+-------+
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: Total review is significantly higher for businesses that are still open vs. businesses that were closed.
   
         
ii. Difference 2: The average stars given were very close to each other 3.68 vs. 3.52. Hence, we can assume that the business which are closed was not entirely based on poor services or poor quality.
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT CASE 
           WHEN b.is_open = 1 THEN "Still Open"
           WHEN b.is_open = 0 THEN "Closed"
           END status,
COUNT(distinct b.id) AS company_count,
SUM(b.review_count) AS total_review,
ROUND(AVG(b.review_count), 2) AS avg_review,
ROUND(AVG(b.stars), 2) AS avg_stars
FROM business b
GROUP BY b.is_open
ORDER BY status DESC

+------------+---------------+--------------+------------+-----------+
| status     | company_count | total_review | avg_review | avg_stars |
+------------+---------------+--------------+------------+-----------+
| Still Open |          8480 |       269300 |      31.76 |      3.68 |
| Closed     |          1520 |        35261 |       23.2 |      3.52 |

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
Identifying most successful businesses in Phoenix based on business category and average stars given by the consumers.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
In order to conduct analysis, we will need data such as business id, stars, review count from the business table and category from category table. On the other hand, we will need to count the companies within each category, the average star rating given by the consumers to assess their performance, and total reviews given to identify if the data is relevant and ensure it's not biased. Lastly, we're only going to check categories with an average of 3.5 or more stars to reduce any irrelevant data.
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
	
	SELECT 
    		b.city,
    		c.category,
    		COUNT(DISTINCT b.id) AS num_of_companies,
    		ROUND(AVG(b.stars), 2) AS avg_stars,
    		SUM(b.review_count) AS total_reviews
	FROM business b
	INNER JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id
	WHERE b.city = 'Phoenix' 
	GROUP BY b.city, c.category
	HAVING avg_stars >= 3.5 
	ORDER BY  avg_stars AND num_of_companies DESC
	LIMIT 10
